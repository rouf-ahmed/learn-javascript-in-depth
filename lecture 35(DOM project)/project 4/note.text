Number Guessing Game - Project Summary

Overview

This project is a simple Number Guessing Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it correctly.

What I Learned

1. JavaScript Fundamentals:

Generating a random number using Math.random().

Handling user input with querySelector and addEventListener.

Using arrays to store previous guesses.

Implementing conditional statements (if-else) to check the user's guess.


2. DOM Manipulation:

Updating elements dynamically using .innerHTML.

Adding and removing elements with appendChild() and removeChild().

Enabling and disabling input fields with setAttribute() and removeAttribute().


3. Event Handling:

Listening for user input and handling button clicks.

Preventing default form submission using event.preventDefault().


4. Styling with CSS:

Adding a background only around text using display: inline-block.

Styling buttons and text for better UI/UX.

Using classList.add() to dynamically apply CSS styles.


5. Game Logic & State Management:

Keeping track of guesses remaining and updating the UI.

Displaying helpful messages ("Too High", "Too Low", "You Guessed Right!").

Implementing a restart feature that resets all game variables.
