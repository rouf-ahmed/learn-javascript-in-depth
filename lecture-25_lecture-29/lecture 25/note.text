LECTURE 25:

I learned Javascript Execution Context and Call Stack in this lecture:

Global Execution Context contains two phases 
1. memory component 2. code execution component --- In memory component memory is reserved for variables(initially assinged with undefined) and functions(assigned with defination)
whereas in code execution component all assignment of variables, calculations etc. are performed.
